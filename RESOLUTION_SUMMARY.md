# Final Resolution Summary - June 25, 2025

## Issue Resolved: Text and Heading Components Not Converting to Skeletons

### Problem

The main unresolved issue was that Text and Heading components in Chakra UI v3 were not being converted to SkeletonText, despite the component detection logic appearing to be correct.

### Root Cause

Chakra UI v3 components (specifically Text and Heading) have a different internal structure:

- They are `forwardRef` components with anonymous render functions
- No `displayName` is set
- Component name detection was failing silently

### Solution Applied

Implemented a **multi-layered aggressive fallback strategy**:

1. **Enhanced Component Name Detection**

   - Better handling of `forwardRef` components
   - Props-based component type inference
   - Special handling for Chakra UI v3 patterns

2. **Improved Text Detection Logic**

   - More comprehensive prop checking
   - Content-based detection
   - Aggressive fallback for unknown components

3. **Final Fallback Strategy** (Key Fix)
   ```typescript
   // If component has string children and no button-like props,
   // assume it's text and convert to SkeletonText
   if (typeof child.props.children === 'string' && !hasButtonLikeProps) {
     const props = getSkeletonProps(child.props, false);
     return <SkeletonText noOfLines={1} {...props} />;
   }
   ```

### Results

âœ… **Text components** â†’ Properly convert to `SkeletonText`  
âœ… **Heading components** â†’ Properly convert to `SkeletonText`  
âœ… **Button components** â†’ Continue working with overlay approach  
âœ… **Complex layouts** â†’ All components detected correctly  
âœ… **Manual mode** â†’ Functions as expected  
âœ… **Edge cases** â†’ Handled by fallback logic

### Verification

- Created and tested multiple debug stories
- Verified all component types work correctly
- Tested complex layouts and edge cases
- Cleaned up debug code and test files
- Updated main stories for proper usage examples

### Files Modified

- `src/components/Skeletize.tsx` - Enhanced detection and fallback logic
- `src/Skeletize.stories.tsx` - Added comprehensive usage examples
- `docs/development/CHAKRA_V3_DETECTION_FIX.md` - Updated with resolution details

### Status: FULLY RESOLVED âœ…

The Skeletize component now robustly handles all Chakra UI v3 components with proper detection and fallback strategies. The aggressive fallback approach ensures that any component with text content that isn't clearly a button gets converted to a skeleton, solving the detection issues comprehensively.

**Mission Accomplished!** ðŸŽ‰
